## **🪐 Concept Description**

FAC2RIO is a multiplayer game focused on team-based economy and space exploration.
Each team starts on a unique planet with basic equipment and must advance technologically to reach the edge of space (100,000 km).

### **🎯 Main Objectives**:
- 🤝 Cooperate or compete with other teams to trade the resources needed for progression.
- 🚢 Build powerful ships capable of exploring space.
- 🏆 Be the first team to reach the end of the universe.

Teams interact freely, exchanging resources or engaging in conflicts. Cooperation is essential to succeed!

## **🔧 Modifications**

Here are the key modifications made to the original *Planet Picker* mod:
- **🛠️ Added a team system**, with each team assigned a dedicated planet.
- **❌ Removed the planet Gleba**, which was imbalanced due to its excessive difficulty compared to other planets.

These changes aim to provide a more balanced and dynamic experience.
